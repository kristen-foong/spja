    """

    """
    Implement a constructor that takes three coordinates (x, y, z) and stores
    them as attributes with the same names in the Vector.
    Default value for all coordinates should be 0.
    Example:
        v = Vector(1.2, 3.5, 4.1)
        v.x # 1.2
        v = Vector(z=1) # == Vector(0, 0, 1)
    """

    """
    Implement vector addition and subtraction using `+` and `-` operators.
    Both operators should return a new vector and not modify its operands.
    If the second operand isn't a vector, raise ValueError.
    Example:
        Vector(1, 2, 3) + Vector(4, 5, 6) # Vector(5, 7, 8)
        Vector(1, 2, 3) - Vector(4, 5, 6) # Vector(-3, -3, -3)
    Hint:
        You can use isinstance(object, class) to check whether `object` is an instance of `class`.
    """

    """
    Implement the `==` comparison operator for Vector that returns True if both vectors have the same attributes.
    If the second operand isn't a vector, return False.
    Example:
        Vector(1, 1, 1) == Vector(1, 1, 1)  # True
        Vector(1, 1, 1) == Vector(2, 1, 1)  # False
        Vector(1, 2, 3) == 5                # False

    """
    Implement string representation of Vector in the form `(x, y, z)`.
    Example:
        str(Vector(1, 2, 3))    # (1, 2, 3)
        print(Vector(0, 0, 0))  # (0, 0, 0)
    """

    """
    Implement indexing for the vector, both for reading and writing.
    If the index is out of range (> 2), raise IndexError.
    Example:
        v = Vector(1, 2, 3)
        v[0] # 1
        v[2] # 3
        v[1] = 5 # v.y == 5

        v[10] # raises IndexError
    """

    """
    Implement the iterator protocol for the vector.
    Hint:
        Use `yield`.
    Example:
        v = Vector(1, 2, 3)
        for x in v:
            print(x) # prints 1, 2, 3

class UpperCaseDecorator:
    """
    Points: 1

    Implement the `decorator` design pattern.
    UpperCaseDecorator should decorate a file which will be passed to its constructor.
    It should make all lower case characters written to the file uppercase and remove all
    upper case characters.
    It is enough to support the `write` and `writelines` methods of file.
    Example:
        with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
            decorated = UpperCaseDecorator(f)
            decorated.write("Hello World\n")

class Observable:
    """
    Points: 1

    Implement the `observer` design pattern.
    Observable should have a `subscribe` method for adding new subscribers.
    It should also have a `notify` method that calls all of the stored subscribers and passes them its parameters.
    Example:
        obs = Observable()

class GameOfLife:
    """
    5 points

    Implement "Game of life" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

    The game board will be represented with nested tuples, where '.'
    marks a dead cell and 'x' marks a live cell. Cells that are out of bounds of the board are
    assumed to be dead. The board grid will always be a square.

    Try some patterns from wikipedia + my tests to test the functionality.

    The GameOfLife objects should be immutable, i.e. the move method will return a new instance
    of GameOfLife.

    Example:
        game = GameOfLife((
            ('.', '.', '.'),
            ('.', 'x', '.'),
